This is the Control-IR project! Created using an Arduino Uno REV 4 and two Arduino Nanos. 
Compatible boards for the receiver code include Arduino Leonardo, Micro, Due, Zero, UNO R4 Minima, UNO R4 WiFi, GIGA R1 WiFi, Nano ESP32, and MKR Family. 
More Info can be found at: https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/usb/Keyboard/ 

The transmitters can be run by building your own circuits through the provided circuit diagrams or through any InfraRed remotes you have. Make sure to run the SimpleReceiver code in the IRremote Library to determine the output signals. 
This code was written for two controllers, but the receiver can control as many controllers as there are keys on a keyboard!
